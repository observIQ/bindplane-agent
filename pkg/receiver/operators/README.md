## Operators

This is a collection of operators that are not present within open telemetry but the stanza based plugins need in order to operate.

This portion of the package exists primarily as a temporary workaround in order to accomdate the gaps between what open-telemetry has and what the stanza-based agent had as a list of available operators.
