# Chronicle Exporter

This exporter facilitates the sending of logs to Chronicle, which is a security analytics platform provided by Google. It is designed to integrate with OpenTelemetry collectors to export telemetry data such as logs to a Chronicle account.

## Minimum Collector Versions

- Introduced: [v1.39.0](https://github.com/observIQ/bindplane-agent/releases/tag/v1.39.0)

## Supported Pipelines

- Logs

## How It Works

1. The exporter uses the configured credentials to authenticate with the Google Cloud services.
2. It marshals logs into the format expected by Chronicle.
3. It sends the logs to the appropriate regional Chronicle endpoint.

## Configuration

The exporter can be configured using the following fields:

### Regions

Predefined regions include multiple global locations such as `Europe Multi-Region`, `Frankfurt`, `London`, `Singapore`, `Sydney`, `Tel Aviv`, `United States Multi-Region`, and `Zurich`. Each region has a specific endpoint URL.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
chronicle:
  region: "Europe Multi-Region"
  creds_file_path: "/path/to/google/creds.json"
  log_type: "threat_detection"
  customer_id: "customer-123"
