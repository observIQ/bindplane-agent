# HTTP Receiver
This receiver is capable of collecting logs for a variety of services, serving as a default HTTP log receiver. Anything that is able to send JSON structured logs to an endpoint using HTTP will be able to utilize this receiver.

## Supported Pipelines
- Logs

## How It Works
1. The user configures this receiver in a pipeline.
2. The user configures a supported component to route telemetry from this receiver.

## Prerequisites
- The log source can be configured to send logs to an endpoint using HTTP
- The logs sent by the log source are JSON structured

## Configuration
| Field              | Type      | Default          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| endpoint           |  string   |                  | `true`   | The hostname and port the receiver should listen on for logs being sent as HTTP POST requests.                                                                                         |
| path               |  string   |                  | `false`  | Specifies a path the receiver should be listening to for logs. Useful when the log source also sends other data to the endpoint, such as metrics.                                      |
| tls.key_file       |  string   |                  | `false`  | Configure the receiver to use TLS.                                                                                                                                                     |
| tls.cert_file      |  string   |                  | `false`  | Configure the receiver to use TLS.                                                                                                                                                     |

### Example Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  http:
    endpoint: "localhost:12345"
    path: "/api/v2/logs"
exporters:
  googlecloud:
    project: my-gcp-project

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [http]
      exporters: [googlecloud]
```

### Example Configuration With TLS
```yaml
receivers:
  http:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:12345"
    path: "/logs"
    tls:
      key_file: "certs/server.key"
      cert_file: "certs/server.crt"
exporters:
  googlecloud:
    project: my-gcp-project

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [http]
      exporters: [googlecloud]
```
