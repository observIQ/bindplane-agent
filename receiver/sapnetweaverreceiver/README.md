# SAP Netweaver Receiver
This receiver collects metrics from SAP Netweaver instance based on the [SAPControl Web Service Interface](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/09/0a40e60d-8b7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html). Stats are collected from the `GetAlertTree` and `EnqGetLockTable` methods.

## Supported Pipelines
- Metrics

## How It Works
1. The user configures this receiver in a pipeline.
2. The user configures a supported component to route telemetry from this receiver.

## Prerequisites
- SAP Netweaver 7.10+
- The ability to authenticate to the OS
- SAP read-only permission
- For SAP version 7.38+,  (Windows: execute permission, Unix: write permission) is required for each instance of sapstartsrv on the host. If this permission is being assigned to a group, the - monitoring user in the group must have the group set as primary. If authentication or authorization check fails the request will fail with â€œInvalid Credentials" or "Permission denied" fault string.
- The receiver must run on host to execute OS executables in order to collect `sapnetweaver.certificate.validity`, `sapnetweaver.abap.rfc.count` and `sapnetweaver.abap.session.count` metrics.
