# Host Metrics with Google Cloud

The Host Metrics Receiver can be used to send system metrics from an agent host to Google Cloud Monitoring.

## Prerequisites

See the [prerequisites](../README.md) doc for Google Cloud prerequisites.

## Configuration

An example configuration is located [here](./config.yaml).

1. Copy [config.yaml](./config.yaml) to `/opt/observiq-otel-collector/config.yaml`
2. Restart the agent: `sudo systemctl restart observiq-otel-collector`

## Setup

Host Metrics does not have setup requirements.

## Process metrics

The host metrics receiver supports per process cpu, memory, disk, and network metrics. This feature requires elevated privileges. On Linux, you must update the service configuration to run the agent as the root user. See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/observIQ/bindplane-agent/blob/main/docs/installation-linux.md#configuring-the-collector) for instructions.
