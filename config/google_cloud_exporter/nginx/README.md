# NGINX Metrics with Google Cloud

The NGINX Receiver can be used to send NGINX metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring.

## Limitations

The collector must be installed on the NGINX system.

## Prerequisites

The `ngx_http_stub_status_module` must be enabled. See the [documentation](https://github.com/observIQ/bindplane-agent/blob/main/docs/receivers.md) for NGINX prerequisites.

See the [prerequisites](../README.md) doc for Google Cloud prerequisites.
