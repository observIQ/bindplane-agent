# Host Metrics with Google Managed Prometheus

The Host Metrics Receiver can be used to send system metrics from an agent host to Google Managed Prometheus. See the [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver) for more details.

## Prerequisites

See the [prerequisites](../README.md) doc for Google Managed Prometheus.

## Configuration

An example configuration is located [here](./config.yaml).

1. Copy [config.yaml](./config.yaml) to `/opt/observiq-otel-collector/config.yaml`
2. Restart the agent: `sudo systemctl restart observiq-otel-collector`

## Process metrics

The host metrics receiver supports per process cpu, memory, disk, and network metrics. This feature requires elevated privileges. On Linux, you must update the service configuration to run the agent as the root user. See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/observiq/bindplane-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/installation-linux.md#configuring-the-agent) for instructions.

## Metrics

Metrics can be found in the [GMP](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/prometheus) web interface.
