# MySQL Metrics with Prometheus

The MySQL Receiver can be used to send MySQL metrics to Prometheus.

## Limitations

The collector must be installed on the Mysql system.

## Prerequisites

See the [prerequisites](../README.md) doc for Prometheus prerequisites.

## Authentication Environment Variables

The configuration assumes the following environment variables are set:
- `MYSQL_USERNAME`
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

Set the variables by creating a [systemd override](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd#Replacement_unit_files).

Run the following command
```bash
sudo systemctl edit observiq-otel-collector
```

If this is the first time an override is being created, the file will be empty. Paste the following contents into the file. If the `Service` section is already present, append the two `Environment` lines to the `Service` section.

Replace `otel` with your Mysql username and password.
```
[Service]
Environment=MYSQL_USERNAME=otel
Environment=MYSQL_PASSWORD=otel
```

After restarting the collector, the configuration will attempt to use the username:password `otel:otel`.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart observiq-otel-collector
```
