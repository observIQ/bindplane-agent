# Metric Extract Processor
This processor is used to extract metrics from logs.

## Supported pipelines
- Logs

## How It Works
1. The user configures the metric extract processor in their logs pipeline and a route receiver in their desired metrics pipeline.
2. If any incoming logs match the `match` expression, the processor attempts to extract the metric based on the `extract` expression. Regardless of match, all logs are sent to the next component in the logs pipeline.
3. Extracted metrics will have the same resource as the log they originated from.

### Example Config
The following config is an example configuration of the metric extract processor using default values. In this example, logs are collected from a file, sent to the processor to have a `byte.count` metric extracted, and then consumed by the logging exporter. The metrics created are sent to the Google Cloud exporter.
```yaml
receivers:
    filelog:
        include: [./example/apache.log]
    route/example:
processors:
    batch:
    metricextract:
        route: example
        ottl_extract: body["byte_count"]
        metric_name: byte.count
        metric_unit: by
        metric_type: gauge_int
exporters:
    googlecloud:
    logging:

service:
    pipelines:
        logs:
            receivers: [filelog]
            processors: [batch, metricextract]
            exporters: [logging]
        metrics:
            receivers: [route/example]
            processors: [batch]
            exporters: [googlecloud]
```

## Expression Language
**DEPRECATED**
The expression language has been deprecated in favor of [OTTL]. Use the `ottl_match` and `ottl_attributes` options instead of `match` and `attributes` for OTTL based expressions.

--- 
In order to match or extract values from logs, the following `keys` are reserved and can be used to traverse the logs data model.

| Key               | Description                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `body`            | Used to access the body of the log.            |
| `attributes`      | Used to access the attributes of the log.      |
| `resource`        | Used to access the resource of the log.        |
| `severity_enum`   | Used to access the severity enum of the log.   |
| `severity_number` | Used to access the severity number of the log. |

In order to access embedded values, use JSON dot notation. For example, `body.example.field` can be used to access a field two levels deep on the log body. 

However, if a key already possesses a literal dot, users will need to use bracket notation to access that field. For example, when the field `service.name` exists on the log's resource, users will need to use `resource["service.name"]` to access this value.

For more information about syntax and available operators, see the [Expression Language Definition](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md).

## How To
### Match specific logs
The following configuration adds a match expression that will extract metrics only for logs with a 4xx status code. In this example, incoming logs are expected to have a `status` attribute.
```yaml
processors:
    metricextract:
        ottl_match: IsMatch(attributes["status"], "^4.*")
        ottl_extract: body["byte_count"]
        metric_name: byte.count
```

### Extract metric attributes
The following configuration extracts the status and endpoint values from the body of a log. These values are used as metric attributes.
```yaml
processors:
    metricextract:
        ottl_extract: body["byte_count"]
        metric_name: byte.count
        ottl_attributes:
            status_code: body["status"]
            endpoint: body["endpoint"]
```
