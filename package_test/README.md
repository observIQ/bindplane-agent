# Linux Package Tests

This directory and it's subdirectories contain scripts for testing installation of the linux packages.

The tests rely on [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (install tests), [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (service tests), and [cinq-auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/).

See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for available test scripts.
