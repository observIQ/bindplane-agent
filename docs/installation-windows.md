## Configuring the Agent

The agent logs to `C:\Program Files\observIQ OpenTelemetry Collector\log\collector.log` by default.

By default, the config file for the agent can be found at `C:\Program Files\observIQ OpenTelemetry Collector\config.yaml`. When changing the configuration,the agent service must be restarted in order for config changes to take effect.

For more information on configuring the agent, see the [OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).

**Logging**

Logs from the agent will appear in `<install_dir>/log` (`C:\Program Files\observIQ OpenTelemetry Collector\log` by default). 

Stderr for the agent process can be found at `<install_dir>/log/observiq_collector.err` (`C:\Program Files\observIQ OpenTelemetry Collector\log\observiq_collector.err` by default).
